#TGF BNF syntax definition

1- <validTGFFile> ::= <nodesDefinition> "#" <edgesDefinition>
2- <nodesDefinition> ::= <nodeLine> | <nodeLine> <nodesDefinition>
3- <nodeLine> ::= <nodeIndex> " " <nodeLabel>
4- <edgesDefinition> ::= <edgeLine> | <edgeLine> <edgesDefinition>
5- <edgeLine> ::= <nodeIndex> " " <nodeIndex> " " <label>


#Semantic restrictions
- In the rule 3, the <nodeIndex> is an integer number used to link nodes for edge definition and <nodeLabel> is the node label. We suggest repeating the value in both fields in order to not confounding both values;
- In the rule 5, the numbers must exist in the nodes definition;
- The graph must have just one root, in other words, just one node must have no parent node;
- The graph must not have any disconnected node;
